- [ ] Create edit/view/delete functionality
- [ ] Implement batch operations UI

## Phase 4: Integration and Testing

### 11. API Integration
- [ ] Connect Angular services to Laravel API endpoints
- [ ] Implement error handling and loading states
- [ ] Set up real-time updates using WebSockets or polling
- [ ] Test API throughput and performance

### 12. Testing Suite
